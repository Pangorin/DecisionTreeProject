# üçÑ Mushroom Prediction Web App
- This project is a simple machine learning web application that predicts whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its characteristics.
üîç How it works
- A dataset of mushrooms with labeled attributes is used to train a classification model.
- The trained model (model.pkl) is loaded into a Flask web application.
- Users can input mushroom features through a web form.
- The app predicts whether the mushroom is edible (e) or poisonous (p) and shows the result on a styled Bootstrap page.
# ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies
- Python (Flask, scikit-learn, pandas, pickle)
- HTML + Bootstrap for the frontend
- Machine Learning for classification
# üñ•Ô∏è Usage
- Start the Flask server (default: port 5000).
- Open the web page in your browser.
- Fill in mushroom attributes and submit.
- Get instant prediction results with clear visual feedback:

‚úÖ Edible mushrooms are shown in green.

‚ò†Ô∏è Poisonous mushrooms are shown in red.
üìå Notes
- This project is for educational purposes only.
- Do NOT use it for real-life mushroom identification, as it may be inaccurate and unsafe.
